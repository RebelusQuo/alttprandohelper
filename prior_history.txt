v3.1
- Christmas DLC is included in the ZIP file!
- Added 1 to each dungeon chest count, since boss drops are mixed in
  with dungeon chests.
- Dungeon chest logic for the location tracker may be a little off until
  I have time to review it, considering the boss drops.

v3.0
- Now has a map that helps new players find chests they may have missed!
- New launcher with multiple options!

v2.2
- Now includes tracker-h.html and launcher-h.html for a 24x2 layout.
  Horizontal tracker doesn't include Agahnim, though :(

v2.1
- Changed the opacity of disabled icons from 20% to 15%
- This version includes a launcher that opens a new browser window for the tracker.
  Internet Explorer works best because it will disable address bar and resizability.
  The launcher will close itself after 5 seconds, which should give you
  enough time to override popup blocker. If it doesn't work, you can just
  open tracker.html normally.
